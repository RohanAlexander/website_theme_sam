Hi, Iâ€™m Rohan Alexander.

I am a post-doc at the Faculty of Information Sciences at the University of Toronto, Canada. From July I'll be an Assistant Professor in the iSchool and Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.

My [academic research](https://rohanalexander.com/academic.html) answers questions in social sciences, such as: are our politicians actually representing us, do elections matter, and how can we make political polling better. To do this I build, clean, maintain, and share datasets in a reproducible way, and then use quantitative methods, such as text analysis, machine learning, and Bayesian hierarchical models, to analyse them.

I run a [brown bag series](https://rohanalexander.com/brownbag.html) about data cleaning, which is more fun than it sounds; please [get in touch](mailto:rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca) if you'd like to attend or present!

Based on my academic research I run a political poll in Australia: [Petit Poll](https://petitpoll.com). This combines non-representative polling data that we gather ourselves with a hierarchical Bayesian model to cheaply deliver meaningful Australian political polling.

Finally, I probably spend too much money on books, and certainly too much time at libraries. You can see some of the books that I recommend [here](https://rohanalexander.com/bookshelf.html). If you have any book recommendations of your own, I've love to hear them.
