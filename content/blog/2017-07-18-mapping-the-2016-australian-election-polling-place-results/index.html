<p>The note that follows introduces Australia’s political system, and then details the process of downloading and merging first-preference votes by polling place, and then plotting it on an interactive map.</p>
<div id="australias-political-system" class="section level1">
<h1>Australia’s political system</h1>
<p>In 2016 Australia’s federal government was determined by the outcomes of elections in 150 divisions which each elected one member to the lower house. The Liberal/National Coalition won 76 seats which allowed it to form a majority government; while the Labor party won 69 seats to form the Opposition; the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team each won one seat; and there were two Independent members (Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan).</p>
<p>Votes are cast at polling places in each division. In general voters can go to any polling place within their registered division, but some polling places that are close to a boundary will allow voting from there and some major polling places (such as the city hall of a state capital) will allow voting in any division.</p>
<p>Although there are some exceptions divisions are generally constructed so that they each have roughly the same number of people. However this is not the case for polling places – some are much larger than others. Nonetheless it is interesting to see the geographic distribution of which party received the most first-preference votes in each polling place, especially in the context of which party won the division.</p>
</div>
<div id="polling-place-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Polling place data</h1>
<p>The main packages for the data manipulation are the tidyverse and magrittr. leaflet allows the creation of interactive maps, ggmap creates static maps, and rgdal assists with dealing with geographic data. rmapshaper is used to reduce the size of the shapefile of division boundaries so that it is faster to load.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(leaflet)
library(ggmap)
library(rgdal)
library(rmapshaper)</code></pre>
<p>The polling place results can be downloaded by state from the AEC website at <a href="http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDownloadsMenu-20499-Csv.htm" class="uri">http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDownloadsMenu-20499-Csv.htm</a>. There the AEC also makes available a dataset that contains geocodes for each of the polling places. The separate datasets for each state need to be merged, and then each polling place needs to be geocoded. Finally some minor changes are needed to make the party names easier to follow.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#### Read in the polling place datasets (are state specific), and the geocodes for each polling place. Then put it all together to have one geocoded polling place dataset for all of Australia: Australia_booths. Finally, create a dataset that is filtered so that it just shows the winner of each booth: Australia_booths_winner. ####

<h1>Division data</h1>
<p>The divisions can be coloured based on which party won overall. The map of the boundaries for each division can be downloaded from the AEC website here: <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/Electorates/gis/gis_datadownload.htm" class="uri">http://www.aec.gov.au/Electorates/gis/gis_datadownload.htm</a>. The shapefile doesn’t have winner of each division so this needs to be merged into it. It is important to put the shapefile dataset first when merging. Finally, the shapefile is quite a large file and this can be reduced for faster loading.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#### Read in the shapefiles (maps) that show each of the boundaries of the divisions (electorates) then add the data to say who won that division. Result is a spatial dataframe called boundaries. ####
