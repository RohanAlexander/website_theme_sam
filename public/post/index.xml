      <description>Introduction ‘Forecasting elections with non-representative polls’ by Wei Wang, David Rothschild, Sharad Goel, and Andrew Gelman, published in 2015 in the International Journal of Forecasting, is a wonderful paper that should be more widely read, studied, and cited.1 It touches on many aspects from across social sciences and applied statistics, allowing readers from a variety of backgrounds a chance to better understand multi-level regression with post-stratification (MRP), and how they might contribute to its development or apply it in their own contexts.</description>

      <description>Introduction Text modelling is an exciting area of research. But many guides assume that you already have a nice dataset. Similarly, web scraping is an exciting way to get information, but not many explanations go on to explain what you could do with it. This post attempts to go from scraping text from a website through to modelling the topics. It’s not meant to be an exhaustive post, but should hopefully provide enough that you can get started with your own project and know where to go for more information.</description>

      <title>Cleaning Hansard: The pay&#39;s not great but the work is hard</title>

      <description>Thanks to Monica for the title.
After getting an email along the lines of ‘hey aren’t you doing something with Australia’s Hansard?’ I realised that I’ve been a bit remiss about sharing my Australian Hansard progress. This is the first of a series of posts to fix that.
{{&amp;lt; tweet 926509282874585089 &amp;gt;}}
I haven’t written about what I’ve been doing with Australian Hansard to this point because: 1) my knowledge of the political science literature is piecemeal and I’m sure someone must have already done all this and I just can’t find it; and 2) my coding knowledge is also piecemeal and there’s no doubt a million ways to better do what I’ve done so far.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Monica for the title.
Introduction SQL is a popular way of working with data. Advanced users probably do a lot with it alone, but even just having a working knowledge of SQL has increased the number of datasets that I can get data from to then analyse with other tools such as R or Python. You can use SQL within RStudio if you want. The following are a few notes to help future-Rohan when he needs to use SQL.</description>

      <description>These are notes that I put together in the process of trying to understand how topic modelling works with a view to applying it to Australia’s Hansard. There are undoubtedly mistakes and aspects that are unclear. Please get in touch if you have any suggestions.
Overview Each statement in Hansard needs to be classified by its topic. Sometimes Hansard includes titles that make the topic clear. But not every statement has a title and the titles do not always define topics in a well-defined and consistent way.</description>

Geoffrey Liu found an error in how I deal with the postcodes data that I haven’t fixed yet.
Introduction The Grattan Institute is an Australian think tank that produces reports about public policy. Last week they released ‘Regional patterns of Australia’s economy and population’. That report looks into the differences between geographic areas across various economic and demographic variables. It includes interactive maps made using Carto.</description>

      <description>The note that follows introduces Australia’s political system, and then details the process of downloading and merging first-preference votes by polling place, and then plotting it on an interactive map.
Australia’s political system In 2016 Australia’s federal government was determined by the outcomes of elections in 150 divisions which each elected one member to the lower house. The Liberal/National Coalition won 76 seats which allowed it to form a majority government; while the Labor party won 69 seats to form the Opposition; the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team each won one seat; and there were two Independent members (Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan).</description>

      <description>(Comment 27 March 2019. This has aged horribly! Not only was it written with a presumption that Clinton was going to win, but even though Greitens won he flamed out within 18 months having been accused of some very odd behaviour. Nonetheless, the visit to Missouri was fun, and I enjoyed putting this piece together.)

      <description>Despite many unforced errors Hillary Clinton has won the Democratic nomination and polls suggest she will beat Donald Trump. But her campaign continues to make unforced errors. There was plenty of evidence of an amateur nature to what should be a professional campaign at a recent rally for Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
The wait for Tim Kaine was around three hours. That’s not unusual. But it meant the campaign had three hours in which no one was able to walk away or claim they had somewhere else to be.</description>

      <description>(Comment 4 July 2017: Like much of my writing about Trump, the opinions here haven’t aged too well. Nonetheless, I learnt a lot from writing this and later from thinking about why I went wrong.)
A few notes and photos from a Trump rally in Indiana earlier this week. The focus is on whether Trump ‘could’ win the election in November. In the interest of transparency, it’s worth acknowledging that I didn’t think Trump could win the Republican nomination.</description>

      <description>The Treasury Secretary, and many others, bemoan the wasted years of the mining boom. Most agree that Australia should have more to show for what was the most significant boom since Federation. But the boom is over. And a fixation on budget surpluses means that we are missing an opportunity to make up for it. Australia’s credit rating is a strength that we should take advantage of. The Commonwealth should be borrowing to fund infrastructure investment.</description>

      <description>Sincere thanks to Bec, Callam, Monica, and Owen for reading and improving these notes.
Bernie Sanders seems quite reasonable for a revolutionary. An energetic man of 74, he spoke for an hour in Perry, Iowa, to a room of 300 from only a few lines of handwritten notes, and then fielded half an hour of questions. He does not have the same aura that surrounded, then, Senator Obama in his own Iowa battle with, then, Senator Clinton in 2008 say those who saw both.</description>

      <description>Originally published in the Canberra Times.
Few policymakers were prepared for the financial crisis of 2007-08. Until it hit, their focus was on more obvious threats to the economy, instead of such an unexpected event. Could this be because planning for unexpected economic events is not the explicit responsibility of any particular policy-maker? If so, this has to change.

      <description>Ronald Coase, one of the most influential economists of the twentieth century, passed away in 2013 aged 102. Reading his papers today, I wonder whether he’d have become an economist if he were making that decision now.

      <description>Written with Ben O’Neill and originally published in the Canberra Times.
The industrial relations disputes that culminated in the shutdown of Qantas last year took more than nine months to make it through arbitration. Such lengthy delays have left many wondering if changes should be made to the processes that underpin this form of dispute resolution. The use of ‘final offer’ arbitration could be the small change that has a big effect, saving conflicted parties time, money and reputation.</description>

The government should use tournaments to stimulate research and development in Australia. They have been largely overlooked since the Cutler Review of Innovation, but when structured properly, they encourage out-standing achievement and promote creative destruction.

      <description>Written with Professor Flavio Menezes and originally published at Australian Policy Online.
There is broad agreement that Australian plastic bag consumption should be reduced. To this end, recent South Australian legislation has banned certain types of plastic bags. But other states wishing to reduce their plastic bag consumption may find a tax rather than a ban the more appropriate policy instrument.
In South Australia, one of the reasons for a ban rather than a tax was the belief that a tax would impose an additional cost on households.</description>

      <description>Originally published in the Australian Financial Review.
The Government’s First Home Saver Accounts policy, announced during the last federal election, is a promise that should never have been made. It will place upward pressure upon inflation and increase the potential for domestic financial turbulence. It will be the individuals that the policy is designed to help (young Australians with a still-insecure financial foundation) that will be most hurt in the long-run.</description>
