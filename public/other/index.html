Grosvenor Public Sector Advisory Consultant, April 2017 &ndash; February 2019

<p>Consultant,   April 2017 &ndash; February 2019</p>
<p>I consulted at Grosvenor on a casual basis to complete a specific project for the European Commission relating to public procurement. This involved: identifying data sources; preparing for and supporting data acquisition; conducting data quality confirmation; helping with survey design and validation; and some minor managerial responsibilities.</p>
<h3 id="the-centre-for-international-economics">The Centre for International Economics</h3>
<p>Economist, January 2012 &ndash; August 2013; August 2015 &ndash; November 2015</p>
<p>The CIE is a privately-owned economic consultancy. I contributed to reports for public- and private-sector clients as part of a small team. Topics included: valuing public sector outputs; housing sector taxation; the global meat market; wheat price elasticities; variations to modern awards; migration; and labor markets.</p>
<h3 id="gocampaign">GoCampaign</h3>
<p>Co-founder and Director, July 2011 &ndash; May 2015</p>
<p>As a co-founder and director of GoCampaign (later GoCatalyze), a data analysis tool, I was responsible for the creation and development of a business along with Andrew Barnes, Chris Eigeland and Chris Hood. There were many aspects to this including creating marketing material and websites; making pitch decks; customer on-boarding and service; presenting; market testing; and some minor managerial responsibilities. GoCatalyze completed the ANZ Innovyz START accelerator program in 2013 and won the iAward Data Category in 2014. GoCatalyze is now part of GO1.</p>

<p>Cadet/Analyst/Senior Analyst, February 2009 &ndash; December 2011</p>
<p>I researched topics related to banknotes, for example an econometric analysis of banknote demand during the 2007-08 financial crisis. I was also responsible for creating and analysing counterfeit banknote datasets, and gave banknote-related presentations to the public.</p>

<h3 id="petit-poll">Petit Poll</h3>
<p>May 2016 &ndash; <em>Current</em></p>
<p>This is a joint project with <a href="https://www.monicaalexander.com">Monica Alexander</a>. Petit Poll combines non-representative polling data with a hierarchical Bayesian model to cheaply deliver meaningful Australian political polling. I am responsible for survey design and analysis, as well as marketing and communication.</p>
<p>We polled the 2016 Australian Federal election and got a (statistically) reasonable result. In terms of seats we were five off. Four of those were just a result of our small sample size: there were the three that turned unexpectedly in Tasmania; and the one in South Australia that went to the Nick Xenophon team. If we had more data from those areas then the model would have had a better chance, but when thereâ€™s not much data the prior has a big impact.</p>
<h3 id="no-pour-choices">No Pour Choices</h3>
<p>July 2018 &ndash; <em>Current</em></p>
<p>This is a a joint project with Adam Jansen and Ben Readshaw. No Pour Choices is an app that helps organise your wine collection. I am responsible for all aspects of iOS development.</p>
